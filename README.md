### Hi there 👋

I'm Sherry, a junior web developer! :beers: </br>
</br>
I've always been fascinated by how much the web can do and how websites are actually marvelous tools to advocate business/personal ideas :star_struck: . I started out my web dev journey as a complete programming newbie on Oct 2020, hoping to be able to build my own website one day. And here I am, with experience of full-stack and split-stack projects, able to work independently or collaborate with frontend devs, I always try to build something fun hands-on to learn more. This web dev journey has been a blast and I've never get tired of any bit of it. I'm excited to dive deep into the programming world to do more! ⚡  </br>
